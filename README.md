# Materials for "Investigating language learning and morphosyntactic transfer longitudinally using artificial languages"

## Content 

The present repository contains the materials used in a project. These 
materials are more findable, accessible, interoperable, reproducible and 
reusable than the materials of most related studies (see 
[poster](https://osf.io/h83yq)).

## Complete materials

The present GitHub repository mainly serves to facilitate the consultation 
of individual files. However, due to GitHub's limit of 100 MB per file, one 
larger file is missing, namely, 
`stimulus_preparation/external_corpora/nowac-1.1.lemma.frek.sort_alf_frek.txt`. 
This file and all others are available in a zipped R project that can be 
downloaded from https://osf.io/download/wbjyr. 

## Documentation

This readme file contains the most general notes. Further readme files 
exist in subsequent folders. For instance, the experimenters 
facilitating the lab sessions are advised to read the readme file in 
the session_materials folder.

## Session materials

The stimuli are prepared in the 'stimulus_preparation' folder, and 
stored in the 'session_materials' folder, along with the OpenSesame 
file for each session.
